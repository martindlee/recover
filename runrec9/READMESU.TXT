Instructions for Running VFP5-8 RecoverS.app single user license as standalone
==============================================================================

(For running royalty free recovpkg files, please see recovpkg8.zip
or recovpkg5.zip with instructions.)

This package has the following files:

README.TXT (this file)
GDIPLUS.DLL
msvcr70.dll
vfp8r.dll
VFP8RENU.DLL
vfp8t.dll

To save on download file size this file set does not have a setup
program. But it is easy to set it up yourself with following steps.

1) Create a directory ("folder") on your drive (say C:\Recover5)
2) Copy all the files listed above into the directory.
3) Copy all Recover licensed package files into the same directory.

You can startup Recover by starting the runrec8.exe file.

You can make a shortcut to runrec8.exe on your desktop - or some other
folder.
