This is a very rough sample to show how the memo trace code
can be removed from memo display and freshened when changes
are made or when a new record is generated.

To run the sample, just load these files into a directory,
set FoxPro default to that directory and "DO SAMPLE.PRG"
This should work in any FoxPro version. (Not sure about
FoxPro Mac 2.6 - may be off screen?)

It is assumed that persons implementing Trace code method
into their tables are experienced programmers. Questions
how to implement Trace coding into your program is generally
beyond technical support. But we can offer programming
services to that end at reasonable cost.

At this point, there is no simple way of when the user
clicks on a memo field in a browse screen.

A real simple solution to the whole picture would be if
Microsoft optionally included Trace coding invisibly
into Visual Foxpro tables in a future release of VFP.
Efforts suggesting that MS have been made but without
much progress as of this date - 09/16/1997.
