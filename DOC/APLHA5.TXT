NOTE: Recover will correct
Alpha5 files require manual changes in the .def file -
change 'FP2X' to 'ALP5'. Alpha5 file memos are not exactly like
FoxPro memos. Gendef will generate a .def file assuming it
is a standard Alpha5 file. After generating the .def file
the string 'FP2X' in the last record needs to to be changed to
'ALP5'. This can be done in FoxPro with Browse or a similar
database utility or with a binary or hex editor to search for
'FP2X' and change it to the 'ALP5' string.
