Visual Foxpro and data protection.

Robert,

DBF corruption and lack of reliable recovery is a vexing 
problem to a lot of FoxPro developers and does not help 
FoxPro reputation. I am writing to suggest a reliable method 
of DBF/FPT file repair/recovery for inclusion in future 
releases of Visual FoxPro.

As you may know, our 'Recover' Fox file repair utility got 
top ratings in September issue of FoxPro Advisor. THIS IS 
NOT A PROMOTIONAL ATTEMPT FOR OUR SOFTWARE.

Recover uses several methods for repairing files. But one 
method in particular, the 'Trace coding' algorithm, is VERY 
reliable in restoring records and memos accurately and is 
currently patent pending. However, it requires extra 
preparatory work on part of the developer:
1) extra record field for the 'Trace codes'
2) extra memo trace code at beginning of each memo and
3) associated program modification in FoxPro apps.
The problem is eliminated and the method works best if it 
was invisibly included as part of Visual Foxpro - perhaps 
as an optional "SET DATAPROTECTION TO" command. Visual 
Foxpro already has the "_NullFlags" invisible field in VFP 
tables. The extra Trace code field could be treated the same 
way and the memo codes could also be invisible.

Including such a reliable data protection feature would 
certainly improve Visual FoxPro reputation.

If you find this of interest, I would be glad to arrange a 
demo and discuss any technical details at your or your 
staff's convenience without obligation.
