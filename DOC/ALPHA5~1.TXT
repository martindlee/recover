alpha 5 database files: .DBF/.FPT

similar to FoxPro files - Except:

1. DBF header field definitions: 
omits byte 12-15 field displacement in record value

2. uses '-' for delete flag.

3. memos in FPT file:

a) 1st 4 bytes indicate size of memo in mBlockSize ( eg 00 00 00 04
= 04 * 64 memo size)

b) 2nd 4 bytes indicate memo text upper limit in 16 byte pages,
terminated by CHR(0) bytes. The remaining bytes used for program
code.
