             Structure Definition file (.def file) Contents
             ==============================================

The .def file is simply another FP2.X database format file and is made up 
of several (character) fields in a record. Each record defines the 
properties of the field of the corresponding database file. The last record 
contains additional database file header information

The name and content of each field is:

Field_name: (C10)
  The name of the field (upper case - except the "_NullFlags" field name).
Type:(C4)
  Character position / meaning:
  1) Upper case character representing the type of the field.
  2) space
  3) This is used by Visual FoxPro tables and has additive Binary values
     1, 2 or 4 indicating whether the field: a) is a system field
     (not visible - like "_NullFlags") b) can store null values and
     c) is a binary type (for memo or character type).
Width:(C5)
  Field width.
Dec:(C10)
  The number of decimals used in a numeric field.
  This is also used for character fields - if it has the characters 'TEXT'
  it indicates that the character field is purely text type and should not
  contain any binary characters - usefull for detecting binary garbage
  character corruption in such fields.
FieldAlias:(C20)
  This field not used in version 2.0.
  In version 1.1 it was used for long field names of VFP or longer names
  to logically represent field names in FP2.X.

The last line defines further properties of the file.
Field_Name: 
  The first four characters are either DB3M, FP2X or VFPX indicating
  dBaseIII/Clipper type file with memos, a FoxPro 2.X file
  or Visual FoxPro file. Next 2 bytes are blank.
  The 6th (binary) character has combination of 1,2 and 4 bit (additive)
  values indicating whether the file has and attached .CDX file, a 
  related memo file or/and is a VFP database file respectively.
  Next 3 characters have the database code page value.
Width:
  The memo blocksize in byte count. ('64' is the standard block size).
Dec:
  The first record position in the file. Note that file positions start
  with the byte 0. For a FP2.X file this is usually -
  32 + 1 + NumberOfFields x 32.
  However, dBaseIII and Clipper created files without memos have
  same structure as FP2.X but they add another byte displacement
  to the first record position - so watch out.

It is recommended that you use GenDef utility for generating the .def
files, since some of the above data is not easily determined and if placed
in wrong position could result in erroneous file recovery.
