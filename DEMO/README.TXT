                    Recover Version 2.0 Demo Information

Introduction 
=========================================================================== 
Recover Version 1.1 was rated as the top FoxPro file recovery software
in the September 1997 issue of FoxPro Advisor.

RECOVER is a comprehensive, automatic, on the fly FoxPro database recovery 
program that can be integrated into your FPW26/FPD26/FPM26/VFP3/VFP5 
software. It has a number of different ways of repairing and salvaging .dbf 
and .fpt files for unmatched reliability and performance. It can recover 
data even from a fragmented file pieces - like 'file0004.chk' resulting 
from chkdsk or scandisk. Version 2.0 includes improved error detection with 
an optional diagnostic only mode, faster recovery of larger files, more 
accurate record and memo repair and international language support for 
progress messages. 

Version 2.0 is distributed in two ways:
(1) as single user license version with a screen interface for ocassional
file repair. The demo illustrates the single user version.
(2) as royalty free, distributable, recover.app that can be called from
your app for automatic file repair without end-user interaction.

This demo comes with sample tables illustrating different DBF/FPT problems.
The demo copy is limited to the three demo initial .dbf file sizes.

You may want to compare RECOVER with other file fixers. Just have 2 copies 
of the sample files (SAMPLE*.*) ready - one for testing RECOVER.APP and one 
for testing other file fixers. Then see how many of the samples will other 
file fixers repair. 

In this version 1.1 demo we have reduced the number of samples to 
illustrate some of the serious file corruption problems that Recover can 
handle and omitted trivial header adjustment examples.

Running Recover without FoxPro programming software
===================================================

The single user DOS and Windows (3.1/95) version RecoverS.app can be run 
without FoxPro software with the "additional files" available on
the abri web site http://www.abri.com/recover.html#FpRun. Recover is
started with the RunRecov.exe file which loads the RecoverS.app - the
main demo file.

Sample damaged files:
=====================
SAMPLE2 AND SAMPLE3 can be viewed beforehand to see the damage as noted
below.

SAMPLE1.DBF/.FPT: Corrupted record AND memo file headers.

SAMPLE2.DBF/FPT: Mixed up memos - You can view the memos before repair to 
  see the mixed up memo data.

SAMPLE3.DBF/FPT: Mixed up records - You can view this file before repair to 
  see the corrupted records. This file includes the trace code in records. 
  The Trace method quickly recovers all available pieces of the record and 
  the memo file without any user intervention. The trace method is an ideal 
  safeguard for your clients sensitive or high security data. No other file 
  fix software can match this recovery method for reliability, speed and 
  absence of user interaction.
