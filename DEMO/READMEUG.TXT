WinPawn 3.1 to 3.2 Upgrade. (1-11-00)
===========================

In all cases of update/upgrade, make sure you completely backup your
current data so that it can be restored to original in case of
problems.

To upgrade from 3.1 to 3.2, install WinPawn 3.2 and then copy the
included UPGRADE.APP file into the WinPawn 3.2 directory (usually
WPAWN320). After starting up WinPawn 3.2 the program will copy your
old WinPawn 3.1 data to the Version 3.2 data directory.
