Running VFP5 RecoverS.app as standalone.
========================================
This package has the following files:

README.TXT (this file)
RUNREC5.EXE
VFP5ENU.DLL
VFP500.DLL

To save on download file size this file set does not have a setup
program. But it is easy to set it up yourself with following steps.

1) Create a directory ("folder") on your drive (say C:\Recover5)
2) Copy all the files listed above into the directory.
3) Copy all Recover package files into the same directory.

You can startup Recover by starting the runrec5.exe file.

You can make a shortcut to runrec5.exe on your desktop - or some other
folder.
